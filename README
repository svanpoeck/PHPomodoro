PHPomodoro
----------

The intent of this project is to provide an easy-install, easy-use, multi-user
web interface for people using the Pomodoro technique[1]

The project is in a *very* early development stage, so completely useless at
the time of this writing (May 26, 2010)

I'll be working on this project as time permits, so don't expect rapid
evolution.

Steven.
